### Late Victorian Age: Aestheticism, New Aestheticism, and Decadence

The Late Victorian Age witnessed a cultural shift towards new artistic movements and philosophical ideas, including Aestheticism, New Aestheticism, and Decadence. These movements challenged traditional Victorian values and norms, embracing beauty, sensuality, and individualism.

#### Aestheticism

Aestheticism emerged as a rejection of the moral and utilitarian values of Victorian society, emphasizing "art for art's sake." Followers of this movement, such as James McNeill Whistler and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, advocated for the pursuit of beauty and the elevation of artistic expression above all else.

#### New Aestheticism

New Aestheticism, influenced by Aestheticism but with a more radical approach, sought to break free from societal constraints and embrace individual freedom and creativity. It celebrated unconventional lifestyles and challenged conventional morality, often exploring themes of decadence and hedonism.

#### Decadentism

Decadentism, closely related to Aestheticism, was characterized by a fascination with decay, excess, and moral decline. Decadent artists and writers, such as Charles Baudelaire and Joris-Karl Huysmans, explored themes of ennui, disillusionment, and the dark side of human nature.

#### Oscar Wilde

Oscar Wilde, a central figure of the Late Victorian Age, embodied the spirit of Aestheticism and Decadence in his life and works. Known for his wit, flamboyance, and iconoclastic views, Wilde challenged societal conventions through his writing and public persona.

#### The Picture of Dorian Gray

Wilde's novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is a quintessential example of Aestheticism and Decadence in literature. The story follows Dorian Gray, a young man who remains eternally youthful while a portrait of him ages and bears the burden of his moral corruption. The novel explores themes of beauty, morality, and the pursuit of pleasure, offering a critique of Victorian society and its hypocritical values.

In summary, the Late Victorian Age was a period of artistic and intellectual ferment, marked by the rise of Aestheticism, New Aestheticism, and Decadentism. Through these movements, artists and writers like Oscar Wilde challenged conventional morality and embraced a philosophy of individualism, beauty, and self-expression.
