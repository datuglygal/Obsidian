### Easter Rising and Struggles for Irish Independence in the Context of World War I

During World War I, Ireland was still under British rule, but there was a growing sentiment for independence, fueled by various factors including cultural revival, political unrest, and economic disparities. The Easter Rising of 1916 stands as a pivotal moment in Ireland's quest for independence.

#### Easter Rising

The Easter Rising was a rebellion launched by Irish nationalists against British rule in April 1916. Led by figures like Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, the rebels seized key locations in Dublin and declared an independent Irish Republic. The uprising was ultimately suppressed by British forces after intense fighting, leading to the execution of its leaders. While initially met with public disapproval, the harsh British response to the rebellion sparked increased support for Irish independence.

#### Struggles for Irish Independence

Following the Easter Rising, the struggle for Irish independence intensified. The subsequent War of Independence (1919-1921) saw guerrilla warfare between Irish republican forces and British authorities, culminating in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which established the Irish Free State. However, the treaty led to division and civil war among Irish nationalists, with some factions opposing the terms and advocating for full independence.

#### World War I

World War I also played a significant role in shaping the Irish independence movement. While many Irishmen fought in the war, both for the British Army and in support of Irish regiments, the conflict heightened resentment towards British rule, particularly due to the imposition of conscription in Ireland. Additionally, the war weakened the British Empire and diverted resources away from maintaining control over its colonies, including Ireland, contributing to the momentum for independence.

### Modernism and James Joyce's "Dubliners: Eveline"

Amidst these tumultuous times, the literary movement of Modernism emerged, characterized by experimentation, disillusionment, and a fragmented portrayal of reality. James Joyce, one of the foremost Modernist writers, captured the essence of Irish life and the human condition in his groundbreaking work, "Dubliners."

#### "Dubliners: Eveline"

"Eveline" is a short story from Joyce's "Dubliners" collection, published in 1914. It follows the titular character, Eveline, as she grapples with the decision to leave her oppressive home life and embark on a new journey with her lover, Frank, or remain in Dublin, bound by duty to her family. Through Eveline's internal conflict and the vivid portrayal of Dublin's streets, Joyce explores themes of paralysis, escape, and the constraints of societal expectations.

In conclusion, the period of World War I and struggles for Irish independence intersected with the rise of Modernism in literature, exemplified by James Joyce's "Dubliners." Through works like "Eveline," Joyce captured the essence of Irish identity and the complex emotions of individuals grappling with personal and societal constraints.
