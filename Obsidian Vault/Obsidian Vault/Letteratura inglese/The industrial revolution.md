### The Industrial Revolution: Two Sides of Industrialisation

The Industrial Revolution stands as one of the most transformative periods in human history. It brought about unprecedented technological advancements, economic growth, and societal changes. However, this era also cast a shadow, revealing the harsh realities of industrialisation and its impact on the working class.

#### The Victorian Workhouse

One of the darker aspects of the Industrial Revolution was the emergence of workhouses. These institutions, established under the Poor Law system in Britain during the Victorian era, were meant to provide relief to the poor and unemployed. However, they often became synonymous with harsh living conditions, exploitation, and suffering.

#### Charles Dickens

Charles Dickens, a prominent Victorian novelist, vividly portrayed the contrasting sides of industrialisation in his works. Through his novels, he shed light on the struggles of the working class and the injustices they faced amidst the rapid industrial expansion.

#### Oliver Twist

In "Oliver Twist," Dickens depicted the grim reality of life in Victorian workhouses. The protagonist, Oliver, endures hardship and cruelty as he navigates the oppressive environment of the workhouse and the criminal underworld.

#### David Copperfield

Similarly, in "David Copperfield," Dickens explores themes of poverty, exploitation, and social inequality. The titular character, David, experiences firsthand the harsh conditions of industrialised society, from child labour to economic hardship.

In conclusion, the Industrial Revolution brought both progress and adversity. While it ushered in an era of innovation and prosperity, it also exposed the darker side of industrialisation, as seen through the plight of the working class and the injustices depicted in the writings of authors like Charles Dickens.
